# NetworkScanner
This is a basic Network Scanner written in python.It scans the devices in the local network.You have to search for an ip or ip range and it will show all the device ip,mac and mac vendor names.  Problems - sometimes you have to search for more than once to get perfect results.   usage: NetworkScanner.py -t &lt;ip/iprange>  e.g NetworkScanner.py -t 10.0.0.1/24
